# DevOps-demo
>Simple web app demo made with DevOps practices.

The project is an authentication web app made with a client entity (html and js), a server one (php) and a mysql database. DevOps developing is implemented with Jenkins.

All this entities are defined with Dockerfiles reachable [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/glatrofa/dev-ops-demo/tags).

Any suggestion will be really appreciated.
